# Cascade Fix

**Learning Objective:-** Figure out what issue is affecting an element, and how to fix it.

### Task:
* You can edit the CSS file by adding, removing, or editing selectors for a declaration block, or by moving blocks around.
* You should **NOT** edit the HTML file or any of the actual styles in the CSS.
-----------------------------------------------------------

#### My Solution:
* I moved `.para` above `small-para`. Here I took advantage of the rule order.
 * I moved `.confirm` below `.button`. Again, taking advantage of the rule order.
 * I changed `.child` to `.text .child`. I thought this declaration would be more direct.
